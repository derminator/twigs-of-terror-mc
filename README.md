# üåø Twigs of Terror üåø

*"Never underestimate the power of a humble stick."*

## What is this madness?

Twigs of Terror is a Minecraft mod that transforms the most basic item in the game‚Äîa stick‚Äîinto an occasional weapon of
mass destruction. This mod operates on one simple philosophy: sometimes, the universe just wants to give you a stick.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Random Stick Gifts**: The server will periodically bless you with a stick, because who doesn't want more sticks?
- **Stick-tistical Anomalies**: Your username determines how often you receive these divine gifts (anywhere from 5
  minutes to 5 hours)
- **Stick Roulette**: Every time you attack with a stick, there's a tiny chance (0.1% to 1%) it will deal catastrophic
  damage
- **Equal Opportunity Destruction**: Works on any mob or player‚Äînothing is safe from the wrath of a properly motivated
  stick

## üìã Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1.191+
- A deep appreciation for sticks

## üîß Installation

1. Install NeoForge for Minecraft 1.21.1
2. Download the Twigs of Terror mod JAR file
3. Place the JAR file in your Minecraft mods folder
4. Launch Minecraft and prepare for stick-based shenanigans

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Do Nothing**: Play Minecraft as usual and wait for the server to gift you a stick
2. **Accept Your Gift**: When you receive a stick, thank the server for its generosity
3. **Use Your Stick**: Attack enemies with your stick like you would with any weapon
4. **Hope for the Best**: Most of the time, your stick will behave like a normal stick (dealing with minimal damage)
5. **Witness the Power**: Occasionally, your stick will channel the power of a thousand suns and obliterate your target

## üé≤ The Science of Sticks

The mod uses a sophisticated algorithm (okay, it's just a hash function) to determine:

- How often you receive sticks (based on your username)
- The probability of your stick unleashing devastating damage (also based on your username)

This means every player has a unique experience with their sticks. Some players might receive sticks more frequently but
have a lower chance of triggering massive damage. Others might rarely receive sticks but have a higher chance of
unleashing stick-based carnage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- Do not taunt the sticks
- Side effects may include: excessive laughter, confusion from other players, and a newfound respect for wooden objects
- We are not responsible for any unexpected stick-related deaths
